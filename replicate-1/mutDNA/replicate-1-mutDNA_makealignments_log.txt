Beginning execution of mapmuts.main.MakeAlignments.
Current time is Tue Aug 30 23:44:29 2016.
Current directory is /fh/fast/bloom_j/grp/oashenbe/2016_NP_MxA_paper/replicate-1/mutDNA.

The R1 reads will come from the following FASTQ files:
/fh/fast/bloom_j/grp/oashenbe/2016_NP_MxA_paper/FASTQ_files/mutDNA-1_1.fastq

The R2 reads will come from the following FASTQ files:
/fh/fast/bloom_j/grp/oashenbe/2016_NP_MxA_paper/FASTQ_files/mutDNA-1_2.fastq

applyfilter = True: all reads flagged Y  by the Illumina filter will be removed.

minq = 25.00: any read pair where the average Q-score of either read is < this will be removed.

upcase = 'test': converting fullgene, a1, and a2 to upper case.
Testing case of first R1 and R2 reads... test passed, first reads upper case.
