This repository contains the code used to carry out the analyses in the paper *Deep Mutational Scanning Identifies Sites in Influenza Nucleoprotein That Affect Viral Inhibition by MxA* available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006288. Code for analyzing the deep mutational-scanning data and the competition data are available in the ipython notebooks `DeepMutationalScanNotebook.ipynb` and `CompetitionNotebook.ipynb` respectively. To run the scripts, the `input/` folder and `runscriptfunctions.py` must be in the same directory as the ipython notebooks.
