Current time is Tue Aug 30 23:48:56 2016.
Current directory is /fh/fast/bloom_j/grp/oashenbe/2016_NP_MxA_paper/replicate-2/DNA.

The R1 reads will come from the following FASTQ files:
/fh/fast/bloom_j/grp/oashenbe/2016_NP_MxA_paper/FASTQ_files/DNA-2_1.fastq

The R2 reads will come from the following FASTQ files:
/fh/fast/bloom_j/grp/oashenbe/2016_NP_MxA_paper/FASTQ_files/DNA-2_2.fastq

applyfilter = True: all reads flagged Y  by the Illumina filter will be removed.

minq = 25.00: any read pair where the average Q-score of either read is < this will be removed.

upcase = 'test': converting fullgene, a1, and a2 to upper case.
Testing case of first R1 and R2 reads... test passed, first reads upper case.

Pylab / matplotlib appear to be available, so we will make the summary plots.

pdflatex is available, so we will also make an overall summary PDF.
